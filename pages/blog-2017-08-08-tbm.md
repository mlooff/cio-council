On July 20, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) co-sponsored an event with the TBM Council designed to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange between some of the leading minds in government and commercial technology leadership.

This one-day event featured panel sessions and open discussions “By leveraging Technology Business Management (TBM), agencies are able to focus more resources on driving their mission. This increase in transparency will enable FITARA, while empowering agency leadership to make good-government decisions on technology investments.” - Mick Mulvaney (Director, OMB)"between the White House, federal leadership and private sector executives. The goal of these discussions was to broaden awareness and demonstrate value of the Technology Business Management framework to the CIO, CFO, CAO and President’s Management Councils.

The existing reporting structure of Federal IT spend lacks the granularity required to create a holistic understanding of investments. The IT Dashboard*, identifies over 80% of IT spending captured through a single, non-descript categorization of funding. Similar views into commercial sector spending offer considerably more fidelity into the components that build up technology related expenses.

By adopting Technology Business Management best practices, the federal government has an opportunity to increase transparency, improve service delivery and arm decision makers with the data necessary to make informed choices regarding their technology investments.

In addition, last July, more than 70 public and private sector IT leaders participated the IT COST Commission to address how the TBM discipline could be applied to the US Federal government. The results of that Commission’s efforts found that if the TBM methodology was applied to the more than $89 billion in federal IT investments, we could save or reallocate roughly $5.6 billion dollars towards innovation.

Throughout the day, the discussion focused on how TBM can change the conversation between IT, the business and the board; how to enable a technology value conversation through cost transparency; empowering governance of IT spending and an overview of existing federal TBM efforts underway.

Further the Summit communicated the Administration’s expectations for adopting Technology Business Management across the Federal government. Armed with this information, cabinet and subcabinet level agencies will be empowered to be better stewards of federal dollars by quantifying the cost, quality and value of their investments in technology.
